# DataWarehousingProject

I completed this project in December 2022 as part of the Data Warehousing 
For Analytics class.

Project objective:

Determine if there is any correlation between K12 school ratings and house
prices in Suffolk and Nassau counties on Long Island, NY.

Build two web scrapers: one for scraping school ranking data and another one
for scraping real estate inventory.

School ranking data was scraped from:
https://www.realestatehudsonvalleyny.com/resources/best-school-districts-long-island/

House prices info was scraped from realtor.com

School rankings and real estate data were then combined into a single fact table.
The data was then exported into .CSV format and pulled into Tableau for visualization.

Resulting visualizations can be viewed in the DataVis directory.
